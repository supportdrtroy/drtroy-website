      "question": "A positive straight leg raise test at 30 degrees with reproduction of leg pain is MOST indicative of:",

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "SLR positive at 30 degrees strongly suggests nerve root tension, particularly with disc herniation. Normal hamstring tension doesn't occur until 60-70 degrees."

        "4 or more",
        "All 5 factors must be positive"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Flynn's CPR requires 4 or more of the 5 factors for high likelihood of success with spinal manipulation."
