## Results Summary

**Total Courses Reduced:** 18 → 10 courses (44% reduction)

**OT Requirements:** 23 CCUs (18 unified + 5 OT-specific)
**COTA Requirements:** 18 CCUs (all unified content)

**COTA Enhancement:** Maintained 18 hours but with more comprehensive content access

**Key Achievement:** NO separate COTA-only courses needed - everything unified or OT-advanced level
